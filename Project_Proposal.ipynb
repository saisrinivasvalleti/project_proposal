        "MOTIVATION:\n",
        "Many hours are wasted in schools and universities for taking students attendance. The attendance system assists teachers in recording students' attendance online during class and reduces manual effort.\n",
        "SIGNIFICANCE:\n",
        "Time-Saving is one of the major significance of this project. Staff and students in secondary schools, colleges, and universities can benefit from automated attendance systems.\n",
        "OBJECTIVE;\n",
        "The project's goal is to automate the attendance system by employing a camera that detects faces and automatically registers people's attendance.\n",
        "FEATURES:\n",
        "Calendar Integration\n",
        "Automated Communication\n",
